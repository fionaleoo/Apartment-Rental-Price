# Apartment_Rental_Price
Final Project at Purwadhika

This Final Project is based on a Kaggle uploaded dataset about apartment rental offers in Germany, scraped from Immoscout24 (https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany).
The objectives of this project are to find out the feature that affects the rent price the most and to predict the total amount of cost needed to rent a proprty.

Thank you!
